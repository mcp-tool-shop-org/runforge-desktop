RunForge v1 Roadmap (Normal + Advanced Mode)
Guiding contract

Normal Mode = status quo ML training app baseline

Advanced Mode = same engine, power-user surface

Every milestone ships a complete loop: configure → run → observe → artifacts → rerun/compare → diagnose

Phase 0 — Foundation and repo hygiene

0.1 — Commit: repo-first guardrails + CI

CI on Windows

build/test pipeline

branch conventions + tags + release template

0.2 — Commit: product identity + docs baseline

“What RunForge is” doc (Normal vs Advanced)

glossary (run, preset, workspace, artifact)

“Definition of Done” checklist in repo

Phase 1 — Normal Mode MVP loop (must feel “real”)

1.1 — Commit: workspace model + run store

workspace folder contract

run folder creation

append-only index + metadata model

1.2 — Commit: run configuration (write-first)

editable config (form + raw JSON)

validation + error messages

save/clone config

1.3 — Commit: run execution engine

launch runs

status lifecycle (queued/running/succeeded/failed/canceled)

stdout/stderr capture

1.4 — Commit: live run monitoring UI

live log tail

progress + timestamps

cancel button (best-effort but safe)

1.5 — Commit: artifacts v1

artifact discovery + status

view/copy/open for common types (images, json, text)

“open run folder” and “copy run summary”

Gate for Phase 1

A new user can: create config → run → see logs → see artifacts → rerun with edits.

Phase 2 — Reliability and “reviewer-proof” usability

2.1 — Commit: crash-safe indexing + recovery

tolerate partial writes

rebuild index from run folders if needed

mark orphaned/incomplete runs clearly

2.2 — Commit: performance + responsiveness

caching + incremental load

large workspace behavior (100+ runs)

search/filter/sort that stays fast

2.3 — Commit: diagnostics bundle

environment snapshot

run folder sanity checks

one-click “copy diagnostics” / export zip

2.4 — Commit: single-instance + workspace lock

prevent multiple instances stomping the same workspace

clear messaging + safe unlock rules

Gate for Phase 2

It doesn’t fall over or corrupt state under normal abuse.

Phase 3 — Presets become first-class (still Normal Mode)

3.1 — Commit: preset registry + editor

create/edit/duplicate/delete

validation + schema versioning

3.2 — Commit: preset import/export

shareable preset files

preserve compatibility across versions

3.3 — Commit: provenance

each run records exact preset/config used

immutable “run record” even if presets change later

Gate for Phase 3

Users can build and share workflows without touching code.

Phase 4 — Device selection and GPU gating done correctly

4.1 — Commit: device detection + selection UI

show detected CPU/GPU/RAM/VRAM

recommended device + “why”

4.2 — Commit: gating rules + explicit messaging

“GPU unavailable because X”

always offer safe fallback (CPU)

never silently block

4.3 — Commit: override policy (Advanced toggle aware)

optional “I accept risks” override

policy controlled via settings (off by default in Normal Mode)

Gate for Phase 4

No mystery failures; every gating decision is legible and actionable.

Phase 5 — Advanced Mode scaffolding (engine-compatible)

This phase is about building the rails so advanced features don’t become a rewrite.

5.1 — Commit: mode system (Normal vs Advanced)

settings toggle + UI affordances

advanced panels hidden by default but same underlying data

5.2 — Commit: run grouping model

“experiment” / “group” entity

link runs into groups without changing run format

tags/notes

5.3 — Commit: compare view v1

side-by-side metrics

artifact diff affordances (at least “open both” + metadata deltas)

Gate for Phase 5

You can group runs and compare them without hacks.

Phase 6 — Advanced Mode v1 features

This is where your “SLOAQ + multiruns” direction lives.

6.1 — Commit: multi-run launcher (sweeps v1)

parameter grid / list sweep

concurrency control

failure handling per-run

6.2 — Commit: SLOAQ-style training hooks (v1)

define objectives + evaluation signals

persist evaluation results into run records

surface in compare view

6.3 — Commit: experiment dashboard

experiment summary (best run, trends)

export experiment report (json/markdown)

Gate for Phase 6

Advanced Mode is meaningfully more powerful, not just “more settings.”

Phase 7 — v1 packaging and polish

7.1 — Commit: onboarding + templates

first-run wizard

sample presets + “what to try”

7.2 — Commit: packaging (MSIX) + update story

signed packaging approach

versioned release artifacts + checksums

7.3 — Commit: final QA + doc lock

known limitations list

“v1 acceptance checklist” verified

Gate for v1

A stranger can install, train something, inspect results, rerun, compare, and file a useful bug report in <10 minutes.
